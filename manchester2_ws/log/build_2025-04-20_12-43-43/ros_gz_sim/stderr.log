[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgz_math_vendor.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gz_math_vendor", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gz_math_vendor"
  with any of the following names:

    gz_math_vendorConfig.cmake
    gz_math_vendor-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gz_math_vendor" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gz_math_vendor_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gz_math_vendor" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
